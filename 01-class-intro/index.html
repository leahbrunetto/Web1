	   <h1>Leah Brunetto</h1>
	   <h2>MIT Class of 2012, Department of Architecture</h2>
	   <p>This semester, I would like to launch an exciting website to function as an art portfolio. 
	   I currently display and write about my work on a Wordpress blog, which is functional and easy
	   to work with, but I would like to have the ability to design my own site and to
	   have my own domain name. I also hope that learning web design will help me to find a job
	   after I graduate this spring. While I have enjoyed participating in projects in academia and 
	   at museums, I would very much like to have the ability to do freelance work or work for a
	   company. Overall, I hope that the skills I gain this semester will give me the power to 
	   create whatever I want, increase my understanding of how the Web works, and make me a more
	   desirable candidate in the job market.</p>
